<h2 class="text-center">The Next Industrial Revolution: Automation</h2>

<p class="col-md-12 text-left">Automation is projected to elliminate millions of jobs. While these jobs will become automated, new jobs will be created in IT and data science. What will become of the people who's jobs become automated? Will they be retrained? Can they be retrained?</p>

<p class="col-md-12 text-left">Some people will not be retrainable. Does a production line worker have the resources, knowledge, and skill to become a data scientist? How can we prepare the current and emerging work force for the changes that are ahead? The benefits of automation are that cost of products and services will likely go down. As we transition into a new largely automated world, companies need to consider transitional training programs to help people after their job becomes automated. Our school system needs to consider the changing job front and better prepare young adults for entering the workforce.</p>

<p class="col-md-12 text-left">When I think of automation, I usually think of production and manufacturing. I usually don't associate automation with a loss of human creativity. The innovation of automating something in itself requires creativity. There have been several recent developments in AI programs that can draw, write, and compose music. A release of the first AI assisted album is expected to be released this year. News sources are already using programs to write short news articles. What does that mean for musicians? Journalists? Artists? Is the future of music AI composed? If computers can create art, will humans continue to be creative? Humans will continue to push their creative boundaries.</p>

<p class="col-md-12 text-left">Automation will effect every industry and touch everyone in some way. As a society we need to be adaptable to the change but more importantly we need to be kind and helpful to each other. Change is difficult but if we starting thinking of ways to ease the transition into an more automated world, we can ensure that people are not left behind.</p>
