<h2 class="text-center">Mod 1 Experience</h2>

<p class="col-md-12 text-left">Mod 1 was an emotional rollercoaster ride. I was challenged in so many ways. Initially I struggled with time management. I am from Denver and it was difficult balancing friend, family, personal and school time. I felt like I was always behind in my school work. I also had to change my approach to learning. I quickly realized that I would never be able to finish all of my work. I changed my study habits and learned to better manage my time by scheduling time for everything I wanted to touch instead of trying to finish something before I moved on to the next topic. Speaking of finishing things, I had to accept that I just couldn't do everything and that's ok. I had to learn to redefine my idea of success. I learned that understanding is more important than finishing an assignment. I also struggled with stress management. Figuring out the best ways to manage stress was a challenge. I was sick for most of the mod and that made things difficult as well. I'm really proud of the work that I did in Mod 1. I was really sick during week six which prevented me from studying much for my final assessments. I went into each assessment feeling underprepared and I did really well. I learned so much more than I realized.</p>

<h3 class="text-center">Advice I would offer to new students</h3>
  <ol>  <li>Keep showing up! Even if you feel like you're not mastering anything, keep going. Even if you feel like the pace is too fast and you aren't learning everything you need to know, keep going. Don't dwell on what you don't know. You will be surprised how much you learn in 6 short weeks.</li>
    <li>Ask for help. Don't spend more than 30 minutes stuck in the mud. If you're struggling with something someone else in your cohort is too. Your classmates can be value resources. Use them! Also be available to help others. Teaching something you have a good understanding of to someone else reinforces the concept for you, so it's actually beneficial to you to help others.</li>
    <li>Take care of yourself. Make sure you're eating, sleeping, exercising. Do whatever you need to do to keep yourself healthy.</li>
    <li>Celebrate your acomplishments.</li>
    <li>Be confident. You know a lot more than you realize.</li>
    <li>You're not alone. Every Turing student has felt every emotion you will experience. Talk to them and they will tell you and encourage you.</li>
</ol>
